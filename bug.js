In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't persisting after adding offline capabilities using the `@react-native-firebase/firestore` library.  The data appeared to be successfully written, but it wouldn't load properly offline, even after a successful `onSnapshot` call.  The problem was specifically related to deeply nested objects within the documents.  While shallow structures worked fine, deeply nested structures were silently ignored or overwritten.
